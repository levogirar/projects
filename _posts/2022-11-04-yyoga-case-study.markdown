## Problem
The problem we set out to fix was the class sign up flow for first time users. They were frustrated and confused when trying to sign up for a yoga class. Navigation was in no way intuitive leaving users doing a lot of guesswork. Common roadblocks were found on numerous pages of the site, creating a lot of extra navigation needed to sign up for a class. 

## Findings
- Users were more likely to navigate the YYOGA site on a mobile device rather than a laptop or desktop.
- Users weren’t interested in the online course option. In-person was overwhelmingly preferred.
- Users found the home page confusing - it was unclear what YYOGA was, and some of the call to action buttons were either unclear or unnecessary.
- Users were unable to book classes from the Classes and Locations pages, and found they had to backtrack through the site from these pages. 

## Idea evolution
Our paper wireframe. Made after in context interviews of Users navigating the current YYOGA site. Learning of the difficulties Users had when trying to sign up for a class and listening to their honest feedback.

During our research we looked up reviews posted online from Users. A common stress point for guests was how crowded it was, causing a poor experience and a negative review. An idea to solve this was to include a ‘loading bar’ on the class sign up page to indicate how many people have signed up already. This way a User would know how full a class was prior to signing up and could book a later class if they wished to avoid large crowds. The navigation bar was also redone to have the most useful links displayed and have a hamburger button to clearly indicate a dropdown menu.

Here our prototype begins to take shape. We arrange frames in order to simulate the flow of signing up for a class. The Book a Class and Buy a Class links were removed from the hero image and replaced with Classes and Location, the two pages that Users were most interested in during our interview. Additionally both links were included in the dropdown menu so it would be accessible from every page. The progress bar that indicated class capacity was replaced with fractions. During our discussion we believed that numbers would be less confusing to Users. 

## Key findings from usability tests
From our usability testing, in context interviews and navigating the YYoga site ourselves we came across a few issues that needed addressing. 

- Information on the homepage wasn’t useful to first time visitors. This left users underwhelmed and left to wander the site rather than following a clear flow. 
- Choice of Language. The Get Started button on the homepage leads to the Membership + Pricing page. This was jarring to new Users that simply wanted to learn more about what YYoga offered and not ready to sign up for a membership. Furthermore two buttons above the navigation bar Book a Class and Buy a Class are prominently displayed. However it is unclear what the difference is between these two options.  
- Navigation. Users and the research team were frustrated that class and location pages, although informative, did not have an option to book directly from the page. This led to a sort of ‘dead end’ which left Users confused on where to go next and forced Users to back track. A navigation bar has a dropdown menu with helpful links, however this is not obvious in any way and is easily overlooked even after multiple visits. 
- Account creation. When Users wanted to book a single class for the first time the site directed them to an external site to create an account with a partner company  Mindbody. Users mentioned this was too much of a commitment to sign up for a single class. 

## Proposed solutions

- Firstly, we decided to tackle site navigation. We did this by having the links Users want most like Classes and Locations, prominently displayed in the navigation bar and a button on the right corner to indicate a drop down menu. This worked well, however this made the navigation bar crowded and the links were redundant when Users were already on the Class and Location page. After a discussion we decided to have those links on top of the hero image and included in the drop down menu. This way they were still the first links Users will see when they first land on the site and would leave the navigation bar looking better. 
- Furthermore we added a Book Class link in the top navigation bar, which could be accessed/easily available from any page on the site. This link leads to the Class page rather than membership and pricing. 
- Lastly, we added in Reserve buttons to both the Classes and Locations pages, which allows users to book classes directly from those pages, rather than having to backtrack and book through the Book Class link from the current site.

## Lessons learned

- We learned how to prioritize and focus on the most important UX issues or flows, by using the MoSCoW technique. This allowed us to set aside smaller issues to come back to later or scrap altogether.
- We learned the importance of getting team alignment before proceeding onto subsequent design stages. This includes being on the same page about what the problems are, and which ones we want to solve.
- We learned the importance of leaving our own biases out of our solutions. We were constantly reminding ourselves and each other of the main ‘problem’ we identified, and made sure we were focusing our prototypes on the right aspects.
